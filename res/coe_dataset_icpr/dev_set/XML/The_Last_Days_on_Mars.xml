Unwilling to let the relief crew claims all the glory, he disobeys orders to pack up and goes out on an unauthorized expedition to collect further samples. But a routine excavation turns to disaster when the porous ground collapses and he falls into a deep crevice and near certain death. His devastated colleagues attempt to recover his body. However, when another vanishes, they start to suspect that the life-form they have discovered is not without danger." language="English" country="UK, Ireland" awards="3 nominations." poster="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4ODgxMDU0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg0NzcyMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="46" imdbRating="5.5" imdbVotes="24,289" imdbID="tt1709143" type="movie" tomatoMeter="20" tomatoImage="rotten" tomatoRating="4.8" tomatoReviews="55" tomatoFresh="11" tomatoRotten="44" tomatoConsensus="Neither intelligent enough to work as thought-provoking sci-fi nor trashy enough to provide B-movie thrills, The Last Days on Mars proves as cinematically barren as the titular planet." tomatoUserMeter="25" tomatoUserRating="2.6" tomatoUserReviews="9901" DVD="04 Mar 2014" BoxOffice="$23.8k" Production="Magnolia Pictures" Website="http://www.magnetreleasing.com/thelastdaysonmars"/></root>
