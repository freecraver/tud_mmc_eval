Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl's ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy's tech savvy and Martin's enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way." language="English, Spanish" country="USA" awards="2 nominations." poster="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NTYzNTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODIwODU1MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="68" imdbRating="7.3" imdbVotes="98,294" imdbID="tt2883512" type="movie" tomatoMeter="86" tomatoImage="certified" tomatoRating="6.8" tomatoReviews="169" tomatoFresh="146" tomatoRotten="23" tomatoConsensus="Chef's charming cast and sharp, funny script add enough spice to make this feel-good comedy a flavorful -- if familiar -- treat." tomatoUserMeter="85" tomatoUserRating="4.0" tomatoUserReviews="54758" DVD="30 Sep 2014" BoxOffice="N/A" Production="Open Road Films" Website="http://www.facebook.com/ChefTheFilm"/></root>
