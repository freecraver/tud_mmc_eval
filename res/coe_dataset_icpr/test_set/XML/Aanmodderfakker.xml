When Thijs visits his sister's house to do some washing, instead of his usual encounter with her semi-perfect family, he meets Lisa, the baby-sitter: a mature sixteen-year-old with exorbitant ambitions. Without intending to, Lisa has a profound effect on Thijs, unveiling a deeply ingrained dissatisfaction with his own passive behaviour." language="Dutch" country="Netherlands" awards="3 wins &amp; 5 nominations." poster="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMzc3MjI1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE2MDU2MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="6.9" imdbVotes="1,436" imdbID="tt3983266" type="movie" tomatoMeter="N/A" tomatoImage="N/A" tomatoRating="N/A" tomatoReviews="N/A" tomatoFresh="N/A" tomatoRotten="N/A" tomatoConsensus="N/A" tomatoUserMeter="N/A" tomatoUserRating="N/A" tomatoUserReviews="N/A" DVD="N/A" BoxOffice="N/A" Production="N/A" Website="N/A"/></root>
