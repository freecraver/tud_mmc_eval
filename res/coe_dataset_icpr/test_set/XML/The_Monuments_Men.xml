It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed? But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements." language="English, German, Russian, French, Flemish" country="USA, Germany" awards="3 wins &amp; 2 nominations." poster="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxMjk4NTM1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg0MjQ3MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="52" imdbRating="6.1" imdbVotes="85,949" imdbID="tt2177771" type="movie" tomatoMeter="31" tomatoImage="rotten" tomatoRating="5.2" tomatoReviews="220" tomatoFresh="68" tomatoRotten="152" tomatoConsensus="Its intentions are noble and its cast is impressive, but neither can compensate for The Monuments Men's stiffly nostalgic tone and curiously slack narrative." tomatoUserMeter="44" tomatoUserRating="3.1" tomatoUserReviews="72112" DVD="20 May 2014" BoxOffice="$78.0M" Production="Sony Pictures" Website="http://www.monumentsmenmovie.com/"/></root>
