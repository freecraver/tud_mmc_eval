Yet within months of pledging himself to the great charter, the King reneged on his word and assembled a mercenary army on the south coast of England with the intention of bringing the barons and the country back under his tyrannical rule. Barring his way stood the mighty Rochester castle, a place that would become the symbol of the rebel's momentous struggle for justice and freedom." language="English, Hungarian, Latin, Danish" country="UK, Switzerland, USA, Germany" awards="N/A" poster="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NTU2NTI5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYzOTI1NQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="42" imdbRating="6.2" imdbVotes="31,428" imdbID="tt1233301" type="movie" tomatoMeter="43" tomatoImage="rotten" tomatoRating="5.2" tomatoReviews="56" tomatoFresh="24" tomatoRotten="32" tomatoConsensus="N/A" tomatoUserMeter="42" tomatoUserRating="3.1" tomatoUserReviews="10713" DVD="26 Jul 2011" BoxOffice="N/A" Production="Arc Entertainment" Website="http://www.arc-ent.com/ironclad.html"/></root>
