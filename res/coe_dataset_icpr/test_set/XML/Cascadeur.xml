It has been missing since world war II. Supposedly, the Nazis hid it somewhere. Christin has been searching for the chamber for a long time, but when she gets close to succeeding, her most important artifact, a key, is stolen by Oberst, a man whose history and intents are unclear. She finds help in Vincent, a stuntman who lives in the deep forest all alone since his big love was killed in an unlucky stunt shoot. From then on, the race for the key and thus for the Amber Chamber gets faster every minute." language="German" country="Germany" awards="1 win &amp; 1 nomination." poster="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNjAwMTA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM4MjgxMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="3.8" imdbVotes="260" imdbID="tt0135831" type="movie" tomatoMeter="N/A" tomatoImage="N/A" tomatoRating="N/A" tomatoReviews="N/A" tomatoFresh="N/A" tomatoRotten="N/A" tomatoConsensus="N/A" tomatoUserMeter="N/A" tomatoUserRating="N/A" tomatoUserReviews="N/A" DVD="N/A" BoxOffice="N/A" Production="N/A" Website="N/A"/></root>
