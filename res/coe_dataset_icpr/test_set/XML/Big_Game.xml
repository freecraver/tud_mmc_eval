In the forest on a hunting mission to prove his maturity to his kinsfolk, Oskari had been planning to track down a deer, but instead discovers the most powerful man on the planet in an escape pod. With the terrorists closing in to capture their own &amp;quot;Big Game&amp;quot; prize, the unlikely duo must team up to escape their hunters. As anxious Pentagon officials observe the action via satellite feed, it is up to the President and his new side-kick to prove themselves and survive the most extraordinary 24 hours of their lives." language="English" country="Finland, UK, Germany" awards="N/A" poster="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxNTc1ODA1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDM3NDE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="40" imdbRating="6.7" imdbVotes="2,008" imdbID="tt2088003" type="movie" tomatoMeter="76" tomatoImage="fresh" tomatoRating="6.0" tomatoReviews="25" tomatoFresh="19" tomatoRotten="6" tomatoConsensus="N/A" tomatoUserMeter="N/A" tomatoUserRating="2.9" tomatoUserReviews="1666" DVD="N/A" BoxOffice="N/A" Production="EuropaCorp" Website="N/A"/></root>
