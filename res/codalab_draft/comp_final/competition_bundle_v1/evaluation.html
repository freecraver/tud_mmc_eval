<H3>Evaluation Criteria</H3>

<p>
	For the evaluation we use the standard metrics
	Precision, Recall and weighted F1 score. Negative and
	positive classes in both data sets are balanced. Participants
	are asked to submit a predicted class for each movie in the
	test data set. The metrics then are calculated and provided
	to the participants. For a transparent and fair procedure,
	the labels used for the evaluation will be released together
	with the results.
